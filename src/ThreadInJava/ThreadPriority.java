//Thread Priority in Java means the importance level assigned to a thread. It helps the CPU decide which thread to execute first when multiple threads are 
//in the runnable state.
//
//ðŸ”‘ Key Points:
//Java assigns a priority number (1 to 10) to each thread.
//
//Threads with higher priority are more likely to be executed before lower-priority ones.
//
//However, thread priority is only a suggestion to the thread schedulerâ€”it does not guarantee execution order.
