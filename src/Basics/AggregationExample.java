//âœ… Aggregation Example
//Aggregation represents a weak Has-A relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent.
//
//ðŸ“Œ Scenario:
//A Library has Students. Even if the library is destroyed, students still exist.
//âœ… Even if Library is destroyed, Student objects still exist.

//Aggregation: Aggregation is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming. 
//It focuses on establishing a Has-A relationship between two classes.
//In other words, two aggregated objects have their own life cycle but one of the objects has an owner of Has-A relationship 
//and child object cannot belong to another parent object.
//For example, a library has students. If the library is destroyed, students will exist without library.
